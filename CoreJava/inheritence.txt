1. Assume that a bank maintains 2 kinds of accounts for its customers, one called
savings account & the other current account. The savings account provides
compound interest & withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The
current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account
holders should maintain a minimum balance & if the balance falls below this
level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that store customer name, account number, and type of
account. From this derive the classes Curr-acc & Sav-acc to make them more
specific to their requirements. Include necessary methods in order to achieve the
following tasks.
a) Accept deposit from a customer & update the balance
b) Display the balance
c) Compute & deposit interest
d) Permit withdrawal & update the balance
e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty if necessary & update the
balance
Do not use constructors. Use methods to initialize the class members.
